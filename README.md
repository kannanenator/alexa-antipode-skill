##Antipode Finder
###What is it?
This is a hastily cobbled together Amazon Alexa skill called Antipode Finder which does exactly what its name suggests, that is, it attempts to locate the antipode of the initial location you provide it. For reference, this is the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipodes) on antipodes. [Here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MYB16FE/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-skills&ie=UTF8&qid=1485747970&sr=1-1&keywords=Antipode+finder) is where you can find the skill on Amazon. 

###Future Plans
* maybe clean up the super hacky javascript
* show off the alexa dev hoodie (if all goes as expected with the [promotional offer](https://developer.amazon.com/alexa-skills-kit/alexa-developer-skill-promotion))

Cheers!
